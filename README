This is Lua 5.2 (alpha), released on 23 Nov 2010
with a hack for true count of table and string sizes.
as of 06 Jan 2011.

THIS IS NOT A STANDARD LUA INSTALLATION. 
Please go to http://lua.org for that.

For installation instructions, license details, and
further information about Lua, see doc/readme.html.


Use:

Use the % operator to retrieve the actual number of
elemets in a table that are not 'nil'.

t = {'foo', nil, 'bar'}
print(%t)

Or to get an estimate about how many printable 
characters a UTF-8 string has.

Compare this with #t. Of course, instead of '%' we
might want to have a function.


Basic direction:

git clone git@github.com:Eonblast/Lua.git lua52
cd Lua52
sudo make <your os> install
src/lua test/len.lua
src/lua test/strlen.lua


Implementation:

The count is updated with every table update and
therefore takes no time when called.
